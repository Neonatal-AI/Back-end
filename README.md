This application is bootstrapped with a package manager called NPM - Node Package Manager.

It's pretty easy to use, but more information can be found here at the [Docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/).

The major dependencies upon which this application is built (though there are many others) are Node and Express. Some very cursory information is provided below.
